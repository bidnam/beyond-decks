# Beyond Decks — Final Narrative Plan

---

## Core Insight

We're told to "win on relationships" and be "trusted partners, not just vendors." But what does that actually mean?

We sell **transformation**—business transformation, marketing transformation, brand transformation. Transformation is a **journey** that unfolds over months and years. But it's also a **system**—stakeholders with different incentives, hundreds of decisions, feedback loops, behaviors that need to change. To shift a company toward a new direction requires sustained force across the whole system.

Our thinking is the catalyst. But we've been packaging it into **decks**—a format that captures one moment, one format, one way of engaging.

A deck can launch the transformation. It can't sustain the force.

**What if our thinking could take more forms?**

The barrier to building has collapsed. We can create lightweight, high-leverage things that give our thinking more surface area—more ways to engage, more moments where it's useful, more durability. Not enterprise software. Tools. Prototypes. Different ways to present and convey our problem-solving.

**THIS is what winning on relationships actually means.** Not schmoozing. Not just being likable. Extending what's possible. Being present in more forms, at more moments, in more ways.

The partners who extend what's possible become impossible to replace.

## The Dual Opportunity

### External (Client-Facing)
- Our thinking takes more forms
- More durable, more useful, more engaging
- Extends our presence across the transformation journey
- Things that pull people back because they're useful—not because they're supposed to reference a PDF

### Internal (How We Work)
- Reusable tools that compound across engagements
- Punch above our timesheets—deliver 10x the value in the same hours
- Learning as competitive advantage—every build makes the next one better
- Proprietary assets, not just billable hours
- A different kind of firm

---

## The Dual Pressure

- **Opportunity:** Give our thinking more surface area. Build assets that compound. And for each of us—a career advantage.
- **Risk:** Decks will feel increasingly thin as building becomes trivially easy. Clients will wonder why they're not getting more.

The value curve is shifting. The teams that start building now will compound their advantage. We should be ahead of it, not behind it.

## Degrees of "Beyond Decks"

Not all "beyond decks" is the same. There's a spectrum—from slightly beyond to significantly beyond:

| | Lighter | → | → | Heavier |
|---|---------|---|---|---------|
| **What it is** | A deck presented differently | A calculator or scorecard | A prototype that brings a concept to life | A tool that lives beyond the engagement |
| **Example** | Non-linear, explorable presentation | "Rate your brand maturity" scorecard | Interactive positioning landscape | GTM dashboard, internal platform |
| **Client value** | More engaging | Applied thinking they can use | Tangible vision they can react to | Durable utility |
| **Internal value** | New presentation muscle | Reusable across clients | Learnings about what resonates | Proprietary asset |
| **Build time** | Hours | A day | A few days | And growing |

All lightweight. All learnable. All compounding.

**Beyond decks doesn't mean instead of decks. It means: decks aren't the only option anymore.**

## The 29-Beat Structure

### THE HOOK (2 beats)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 0 | **Beyond Decks** | Title. Intrigue. |
| 1 | **The Question** | "Win on relationships. Be trusted partners." We've heard it a thousand times. But what does it actually mean to be indispensable? |

---

### THE TENSION (4 beats)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 2 | **We Sell Transformation** | A journey that unfolds over months and years. A system that requires sustained force. |
| 3 | **We Deliver Moments** | We package our thinking into decks. Beautiful. Portable. Persuasive. They travel through organizations, align stakeholders, evangelize ideas. |
| 4 | **Then We Leave** | We hand off the recipe and leave the kitchen. |
| 5 | **The Paradox** | You can't be a true partner to a journey you're not on. |

---

### THE BRIDGE (1 beat)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 6 | **Why We Leave** | Our thinking ends where the deck ends. Not because we chose to stop—but because building anything more meant different talent, different timelines, different economics. So our thinking stayed locked in a passive format, its value depending on someone else to act on it. |

---

### THE SHIFT (3 beats)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 8 | **That's Changed** | The barrier to building has collapsed. The same 40 hours that used to produce a deck can now produce a deck *and* a working prototype. |
| 9 | **"But We're Not Developers"** | You don't need to be. The thinking is the hard part. The building just got accessible. Your expertise is what matters — the form it takes can change. |
| 9b | **The Shape Changes** | The core stays, the shape changes. Architects still design spaces — they stopped drafting by hand. Journalists still break stories — they stopped setting type. Strategists still solve problems — the deliverable doesn't have to be a deck. |
| 10 | **Evidence** | The evidence that this shift is real and accelerating. |

---

### THE PRESSURE (2 beats)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 11 | **The Opportunity** | We can give our thinking more surface area. Build assets that compound internally. And for each of us—this is a career advantage. The people who learn this now won't just be executing the work. They'll be shaping what the work becomes. |
| 12 | **The Risk** | Decks will feel increasingly thin. Clients will wonder why they're not getting more. The value curve is shifting—we should be ahead of it. |

---

### THE PROVOCATION (5 beats)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 13 | **A New Model** | What if our thinking could take more forms than a deck? Our thinking is still the value. It always will be. Now it can take more forms. |
| 14 | **Extend AND Expand** | Our thinking doesn't just go deeper—it goes wider. A deck touches one moment, one room. Tools can live in more parts of the system—different teams, different stages, different decisions. More surface area means more sustained force on the transformation. |
| 15 | **The Compounding Effect** | It's not just value now—it's value that compounds. Decks get filed. Tools get reused, refined, built upon. Every build makes the next one faster. Every project makes the next one better. This is what productizing actually looks like. And unlike a deck, a tool gives you signal—you can see if people use it, where they engage, what they come back to. Your thinking gets a feedback loop. |
| 16 | **It Fits How We Already Work** | This isn't a pivot. It's an extension. The same thinking, the same hours—just more forms for it to take. And as the tools keep getting better, what's possible keeps expanding. |
| 17 | **The Spectrum** | From decks presented differently → calculators and scorecards → prototypes → tools that keep working. This is where to start—not where it stops. All learnable. All compounding. |

---

### THE PROOF (4 beats)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 18 | **What This Looks Like** | Three examples. Three transformations. |
| 19 | **Positioning** | A deck gets presented once and filed. A landscape gets revisited—when a competitor moves, when a new opportunity emerges, when the team needs to make a call. |
| 20 | **Journey** | A map is a snapshot of something that never stops moving. An explorer moves with it. |
| 21 | **GTM** | A playbook tells you what to do. A dashboard helps you decide what to do *now*. |

---

### THE PAYOFF (3 beats)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 22 | **THIS is What It Means** | Callback to Beat 1. This is what winning on relationships actually means. |
| 23 | **Being Indispensable** | Not schmoozing. Extending what's possible. Thinking that doesn't stop when the meeting ends. |
| 24 | **True Partners** | Not consultants who hand off and leave. Partners whose thinking stays in the room. |

---

### THE INVITATION (4 beats)

| # | Beat | Core Message |
|---|------|--------------|
| 25 | **Start Small** | Spend an hour with the tools. Build something. See what's possible. |
| 26 | **Ask the Question** | On every engagement: "Could this be more than a deck?" |
| 27 | **Compound Your Advantage** | Every build teaches you. Every tool can be reused. The learning compounds. |
| 28 | **Become the Partner** | The ones who extend what's possible become impossible to replace. |

## Research & Evidence

### The Numbers
- **AI generates 41% of all code globally** (Google, 2024) — 256 billion lines
- **70% of new apps will be built outside traditional IT** by end of year (Gartner)
- **Lovable hit $100M ARR** — "potentially the fastest company in history" (Ben's Bites)
- **Projects: $50K + 6 months → $500 + 1 week** (JP Morgan vibe coding report)
- AI consulting market: **$11B (2025) → $91B (2035)** — 26% CAGR

### Key Voices

**Ethan Mollick (Wharton, "One Useful Thing")**
> "Can't code? Definitely plan on making a working app."

> "What's most exciting about AI is its potential for expanding the number of people able to produce and share useful innovations."

- His students: idea → working prototype in one class session (90 minutes)

**Ben Tossell (Ben's Bites)**
> "The future of work will be directly related to how technically-able you are. Not whether you can code per se, but how well you can work alongside developers and contribute."

**Every.to**
> "Almost all of our prototypes are built without any manual coding—and it's the non-technical people, specifically the product and design teams, who are the ones most aggressively building them."

**Claire Vo (CPO, LaunchDarkly; Founder, ChatPRD)**

Built a six-figure AI business as a side project—over Thanksgiving weekend—while running product and engineering at LaunchDarkly.

> "It's so cheap and easy to build high-quality web apps right now."

> "A SaaS app that took me many months to build pre-AI would now take me a day."

> "Technical is a funny word. It can mean I understand computer science, it can mean I can code, or it can mean I can build things. I think we need to disambiguate when we're talking about being 'technical'... Being a PM won't require computer science degrees, but will require being able to build."

> "All roles are gonna change, why not this one? People should be changing already. And I think if you haven't started down that journey, you're going to be too late."

> "Building solo does increase quality and velocity… because you're short-circuiting the loop between product, engineering, and design."

**"Vibe Coding"**

The term coined by Andrej Karpathy for a new way of building: you describe what you want in natural language, and AI writes the code. You're directing, not programming.

> "You stop thinking like a traditional programmer. You give in to the flow, ignore the underlying code, and just tell your AI assistant what you want."

### Historical Parallel: Desktop Publishing (1985)

In 1985, the Mac and PageMaker arrived. Many designers resisted: "We're designers, not typesetters."

The designers who moved first found their thinking could travel farther—more iterations, more control, more leverage. That advantage compounded over time.

**The Pattern:**
A new tool blurs a professional boundary. Early movers gain leverage. That leverage compounds.

**The signs are clear that we're in one of these moments now.** And given the breadth of what AI touches—not just design, but writing, analysis, code, strategy, and more—this one is likely larger than the ones that came before.

| Desktop Publishing (1985) | AI-Enabled Building (2025) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| "We're designers, not typesetters" | "We're strategists, not developers" |
| The Mac collapsed the boundary | AI is collapsing the boundary |
| Early movers found leverage that compounded | Early movers are finding leverage that compounds |
| Touched one profession (design) | Touches many professions simultaneously |

## Call to Action

### For Individuals

1. **Try the tools** — Spend an hour with Lovable, Replit, or Claude. Build something small. See what's possible.

2. **Ask the question** — On every engagement: "Could this be more than a deck?" The answer is usually yes.

3. **Compound your learning** — Every build teaches you something. Start now and be six months ahead of those who start in six months.

### For the Firm

1. **Create permission** — Make it safe to experiment, prototype, and share learnings.

2. **Build a library** — Reusable tools, templates, frameworks that compound across engagements.

3. **Evolve the model** — Think about how billing, staffing, and scoping change when the barrier to building has collapsed.

### Tools to Explore
- Lovable
- Replit
- Claude / Claude Code
